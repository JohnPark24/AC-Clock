Animal Crossing Clock

Made with: 
HTML, CSS, Javascript

Purpose of this project:
I originally wanted to make a Animal Crossing themed website that changes with the time and season. What I realized however, is that 
Javascript would have to do a check every single minute in order to do the task I originally wanted.

What to do in the future:
Learn languages that can better run at specific times of the day like python or applescript.# AC-Clock
